This project is a wrapper around [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs/)
with logic to recursively find and generate documentation for all modules in a directory. In order for
a module to be considered for documentation, its directory (or any of its parent directories)
must contain a [terraform-docs configuration file](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/configuration/).
`terraform-docs-recursive` will search use whichever configuration file is found first in the directory tree.
